# open FVD++ v0.8(?) #

Fork of openFVD, originally created by Stephan (Lenny) Alt et al., 2012-2016, alt.stephan@web.de

# Introduction #

FVD++ revival.

# Compilation on Windows #
- Download [Qt 5.14.2](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/) for Windows, which should include Qt Creator.
- Download [glm-0.9.5.1](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/download/0.9.5.1/glm-0.9.5.1.zip)
- Download [glew-1.12.0-win32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.12.0/glew-1.12.0-win32.zip/download)
- Extract both libraries.
- Change: `INCLUDEPATH += "path\to\fvd_deps\glew-1.12.0\include"`, `INCLUDEPATH += "path\to\fvd_deps\glm", `LIBS += "path\to\fvd_deps\glew-1.12.0\lib\Release\x64\glew32.lib"` in fvd_win.pro.
- Compile using the `MinGW-64` kit in Qt Creator.

# Housekeeping #

- `clang-format -style=llvm`
- Change paths to deps. in `fvd.pro`.

- fixed compilation errors on clang
- reverted performance improvements due to fatal bugs

v0.78:
- fixed export of straight sections with non zero roll transitions
- fixed camera stuttering
- fixed distance based forced sections
- first 64bit Release

v0.77 (open Source release):
- fixed export of individual sections
- fixed force based sections not saving constant speed
- changed to Qt 5.2.1, qcustomplot 1.2.1 and glm 0.9.5.1-1

v0.76 Beta:
- fixed tozero transitions to only work on the first section properly
- fixed velocity problems on some section types
- fixed NL2 exporter exporting non rotated sections (when exporting a subset of FVD sections)

v0.75 Beta:
- double spine track style
- new exporter type: NL2 exporter
- NL2 style friction parameters
- EXPERIMENTAL: export coaster to .3ds file format
- EXPERIMENTAL: "roll back to zero" transition type for force and geometric time based sections

v0.7b Beta:
- fixed having no control over the camera in OpenGL 2 mode
- FVD now loads a double-clicked project on startup if the .fvd file format is asociated with the FVD++ executable
- fixed camera having gimbal lock related issues

v0.7a Beta:
- fixed unsufficient mesh update in combination with smoothing
- fixed spine and rails disappearing at the end of the track on rare occasions

v0.7 Beta:
- added fully rendered tracks as well as several track styles
- improved drag and speed calculations
- new keybindings during fly mode (change POV position by pressing the arrow keys, B toggles the NoLimits 1 building border, F goes into fullscreen)
- several graphics options
- straight segments are now exported as one NoLimits 1 segment (please tell me if you really need the old system back)
- performance increase in track generation
- imported NoLimits 1 tracks have now simulated physics
- transition editor with mutliple y-axes

v0.6 Beta:
- added a rollspeed smoothing tool
- improved both tangent and spline exporter by a significant margin
- improved coaster physics (you can load 0.5x .fvd files but your track may be misshapen due to the new physics engine)

v0.51 Beta:
- fixed two bugs leading to crashes on most Mac and some Windows systems
- minor bug fix in the options menu and section list

v0.5 Beta:
- all new GUI
    - project tab lets you manage multiple tracks in one project
    - each track has its own management tab
    - improved graph window with tons more options
- import tracks from other FVD++ projects
- import from *.nltrack format (for now FVD++ assumes a closed track and calculates no physics)
- customizable background and track colors
- customizable ground texture (only viewable in OpenGL 3 mode)
- additional anchor point options
- improved track flexion visualization

v0.31 Beta:
- better Mac compatibility (enabled earlier OpenGL versions and removed some external dependencies)
- fixed issue with symmetric functions

v0.3 Beta:
- improved visuals for non legacy OpenGL (improved shadows and selected subsection gets a green highlight)
- added undo / redo support
- added options window
- added conversion panel window
- added roll orientation option
- added function argument option
- fixed spinning camera bug which occured on some systems
- reworked tangent exporter (new standard exporter for now)
- new Mac version (now also with OpenGL 3 support)

v0.14a Alpha:
- fixed floor in PoV mode (legacy OpenGL only)

v0.14 Alpha:
- trackwork now invariant under position and rotation changes of the anchor point
- improved visuals for non legacy OpenGL (underground track distinguishable)
- Anchor Node represents now the anchor of the track rather than the anchor of the Heartline

v0.12 Alpha:
- Mac version (64 bit only)
- new exporter option (export as spline or export with preserving tangents)
- fixed a slight bug in straight sections using non zero roll functions (section didn't preserve length of heartline)

v0.11 Alpha:
- new exporter option (threshold angle at which the exporter decides to switch to RelRoll option)
- Compatibility with OpenGL version 3.0 and lower. Visualizations will automatically be disabled! Check *.log file which OpenGL context could be created on your machine
- Fixed a bug on functions the train will never be able to reach

v0.1 Alpha:
- introduction of 4 different section types (straight, curved, force based, geometry based)
- introduction of 6 different transition types (with 12 different flavors)
- timewarping of all transition types
- Exporter to the *.nlelem format with per section exporting and variable segment lengths
- save to and load from a lightweight data format (*.fvd files) with autosaves to a (*.bak) file each time an export is performed.
- OpenGL shaders visualising important data (like forces, roll speed and track flexion).
- PoV mode enabling the ability to check the track inside FVD++
